							<h1>Hello there! We are Aleksandra and Randy. </h1>
							
						
							<p className="py-2">
							On our first trip to San Antonio, we fell in love with this Cityâ€™s charm. We were captivated by the enchanting beauty of the Riverwalk, the rich history of the Alamo, and the vibrant energy of Hemisphere Park's festivities.

It is our privilege to open the doors of this lovely home to you and other guests. We have hosted families, couples, gatherings of friends and family, members of the military and business travelers.
